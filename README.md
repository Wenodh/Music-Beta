🎵 **Introducing My Latest Project: Music Beta!** 🎵

I’m excited to share a music app I’ve been working on! Inspired by a tutorial by [Raj Padval](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-padval-10869125b/) on YouTube ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1h-wu-oDk8)), I took the base and built it into something more dynamic and responsive. 

A big **thank you** to Raj for the inspiration! 🙏
